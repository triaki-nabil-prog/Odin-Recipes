    <h2>ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>½ cup semolina flour</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons semolina flour</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons sesame seeds, divided</li>

        <li> 1 tablespoon white sugar</li>

        <li> 1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>

        <li> ¾ teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>

        <li>1 egg</li>

        <li> 1 egg, separated</li>

        <li>1 cup lukewarm milk</li>

        <li> 2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>

        <li> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>

        <li> 1 teaspoon water</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>Step 1
            Mix 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons semolina, 2 tablespoons sesame seeds, sugar, yeast, and salt together in a
            large bowl. Whisk in oil, egg, and egg white. Stir in warm milk slowly until a liquid dough forms.</li>

        <li>Step 2
            Cover the bowl with a plate or plastic wrap; let stand at room temperature until frothy, about 1 hour.</li>

        <li>Step 3
            Stir in 2 3/4 cups flour with a wooden spoon until a sticky dough forms. Cover again and allow to rest for
            30 minutes.</li>

        <li>Step 4
            Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a baking mat.</li>

        <li>Step 5
            Sprinkle 1 tablespoon flour over the dough and your hands. Mix dough, adding flour as needed, 1 tablespoon
            at a time, until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Shape into a round loaf and place on the prepared
            baking sheet. Cover loosely with a towel and let rise for 1 hour in a warm place until loaf doubles in
            volume.</li>

        <li>Step 6
            Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Step 7
            Beat egg yolk and water in a bowl with a fork; brush over the entire surface of the loaf. Sprinkle 1
            tablespoon sesame seeds on top.</li>

        <li>Step 8
            Bake in the preheated oven until loaf is golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes.</li>

    </ul>
