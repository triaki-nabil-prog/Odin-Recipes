            <ul>
                <li>3 cups water

                <li>2 cups couscous

                <li>1 tablespoon butter

                <li>3 tablespoons harissa
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>Step 1
            Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Season mutton chops and chicken
            drumsticks with salt and pepper; cook in batches with onions in the hot oil until browned, about 2
            minutes
            per side. Transfer to a large plate.</li>

        <li>Step 2
            Scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to release browned bits. Return mutton chops and
            chicken to
            the pot. Pour in enough water to cover; add turmeric, cumin, and coriander. Cover and bring to a
            boil.
            Reduce heat to medium; simmer for 20 minutes.</li>

        <li>Step 3
            Stir potatoes, turnips, and carrots into the pot. Simmer, covered, until vegetables start to soften,
            about
            10 minutes. Mix in tomato paste and ras el hanout; cook for 10 minutes. Stir in chickpeas, zucchini,
            and
            cilantro; continue cooking, covered, until zucchini is tender, about 5 minutes.</li>

        <li>Step 4
            Bring 3 cups water to a boil in a saucepan; remove from heat and stir in couscous and butter. Cover
            saucepan
            and let stand until water is absorbed completely, 5 to 10 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork and
            stir in 1
            tablespoon olive oil. Transfer to a serving dish.</li>

        <li>Step 5
            Ladle 2 scoops of cooking liquid into a bowl; mix in harissa until smooth.</li>

        <li>Step 6
            Scoop vegetables onto a serving plate. Scoop mutton and chicken onto a separate plate. Serve
            alongside
            couscous, harissa sauce, and remaining cooking liquid in the pot.</li>

    </ul>
