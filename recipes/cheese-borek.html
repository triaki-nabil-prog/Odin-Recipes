    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The usual filling is feta cheese; this version calls for smoked Gouda and Emmenthal. If you have never worked
        with phyllo before, know that it is very fragile and must be kept covered or it will dry out very quickly. This
        is labor-intensive, but worth it. I like to divide the filling ahead of time into 48 equal little portions to
        ensure that all the borek are uniform in size. This may be made a day before they are baked, and stored covered
        in the refrigerator.</p>

    <h2>ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>

        <li>1 bunch fresh parsley, minced</li>

        <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

        <li> ¾ teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>

        <li> 6 ounces smoked Gouda cheese, shredded</li>

        <li> 6 ounces Emmentaler cheese, finely shredded</li>

        <li>12 sheets phyllo dough</li>

        <li> 1 ½ cups unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ul>

    <li> Step 1
        In a medium bowl, whisk together egg, parsley, garlic and crushed red pepper. Mix in Gouda and Emmentaler.</li>

    <li>Step 2
        One sheet at a time, place phyllo dough on a flat surface and brush with about 1 tablespoon butter. Cut
        lengthwise into 4 strips. Place a rounded teaspoon of the egg mixture at one end of each strip. Fold corner of
        strip over the filling, forming a triangular fold. Continue folding the length of the strip in triangular folds
        to form a small stuffed triangle. Repeat with remaining phyllo dough.</li>

    <li>Step 3
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly butter a large baking sheet.</li>

    <li>Step 4
        Arrange stuffed phyllo triangles in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven 30
        minutes, or until lightly browned. Serve warm.</li>

    </ul>
