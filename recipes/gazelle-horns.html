                <li> 1 ½ tablespoons orange blossom water</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li> Decorating:

            <ul>

                <li> 6 tablespoons honey</li>

                <li> 1 tablespoon orange blossom water</li>

                <li> 3 tablespoons crushed pistachios, or to taste</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ul>

        <li> Step 1
            Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread
            almonds over
            the baking sheet.</li>

        <li>Step 2
            Bake in the preheated oven until almonds are fragrant and roasted, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>

        <li>Step 3
            Prepare pastry dough while almonds are roasting. Combine flour, 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon butter,
            and salt
            in a bowl and rub together until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add egg, oil, and 1 1/2
            tablespoons
            orange blossom water; knead everything into a smooth pastry dough. Add a little water, 1 teaspoon at
            a time,
            if dough is too dry. Shape pastry dough into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and set aside for 30
            minutes.</li>

        <li>Step 4
            Remove almonds from oven and cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Place almonds in the bowl of a food
            processor;
            process until finely and evenly ground. Add 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar, cinnamon, egg, and 1
            tablespoon
            orange blossom water in that order to the food processor, pulsing after each addition until mixture
            is
            evenly combined and resembles a paste.</li>

        <li>Step 5
            Remove small walnut-sized portions of filling with greased hands. Roll them into small logs with
            thin ends.
            Set aside.</li>

        <li>Step 6
            Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>

        <li>Step 7
            Roll out half of the pastry dough on a lightly floured surface until very thin. Place one of the
            almond
            paste logs on the edge of the pastry, fold pastry over the filling, covering it completely, and seal
            the
            edges. Mold with your fingers into a crescent shape. Using a pastry cutter, cut around the crescent,
            and
            transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.</li>

        <li>Step 8
            Bake in the preheated oven until gazelle horns are lightly golden and baked through, about 20
            minutes. They
            should not get too dark. Let cool slightly, about 3 minutes.</li>

        <li>Step 9
            Heat honey in a small saucepan over low-medium heat. Remove from heat and stir in 1 tablespoon
            orange
            blossom water. Dip gazelle horns into the honey and place on a serving plate. Sprinkle with crushed
            pistachios.</li>
    </ul>
