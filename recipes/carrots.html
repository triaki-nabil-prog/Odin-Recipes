    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This easy side dish is flavored with a spice mix of cinnamon, cumin, garlic, and bay leaf, then finished with
        lemon juice.</p>

    <h2>ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li> 1 ½ cups water</li>

        <li> 2 pounds carrots, peeled and sliced</li>

        <li> 5 tablespoons olive oil</li>

        <li> 1 teaspoon salt</li>

        <li> ½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

        <li> ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>

        <li> ½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>

        <li> 3 cloves cloves garlic, crushed</li>

        <li> ½ teaspoon dried thyme leaves</li>

        <li> 1 bay leaf</li>

        <li> 1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Step 1
        Place a steamer insert into a saucepan, and fill with 1 1/2 cups of water, or just below the bottom of the
        steamer. Cover, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add the sliced carrots, reduce the heat to medium,
        and cover the pan again. Steam until tender but not mushy, 4 to 6 minutes depending on the thickness of the
        slices. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid.</li>

    <li>Step 2
        Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and stir in the salt, pepper, cinnamon,
        cumin, garlic, and thyme. Cook the spices and garlic, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 10 minutes. Add
        the 1/2 cup reserved cooking liquid and the bay leaf, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>

    <li>Step 3
        Stir in the carrots, tossing well to coat with the spice mixture, and cook until heated through, about 2 to 3
        minutes. Sprinkle with lemon juice and remove the bay leaf before serving.</li>
    </ul>
